# Zettelkasten

> ‚Äú[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Hamming

A Zettelkasten is a personal knowledge management system designed to organize and interlink ideas, notes, and information. Originating from the German scholar Niklas Luhmann, the system relies on creating individual "slips" or "cards" (zettels) for each idea, which are then connected through unique identifiers and cross-references. This method helps users discover connections between seemingly unrelated topics, fostering deeper understanding and creativity. It is often used for writing, research, and complex problem-solving.
